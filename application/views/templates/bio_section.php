        <h1>BIOGRAPHY OF SHEIKH SAID JOHN</h1>
        <h5>Overview of Sheikh Said John </h5>
        <p>
            Sheikh Said John was born in a committed Christian family in a miraculous way. At the age of six months, the signs of Islamic religion began to be seen in
            him. At the age of three, he went ahead and denounced his parents’ Christian religion where he began reciting Quran and Hadeeth verses without being taught
            by anybody.
        </p>

        <p><strong>The Life History of Sheikh </strong> Said<strong> </strong><strong>John </strong></p>
        <p>
            Sheikh Said John was born on 8<sup>th</sup> December 1989 on Friday morning in mount Meru regional hospital. Immediately after he was born, the doctors and
            midwives declared him dead. However, on their way home to bury him, he screamed loud and cried thus brought back her parent’s morale which was low.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was then baptized in accordance with Pentecostal church and acquired an English name Joseph. However, this baptismal didn’t bring joy as expected by his
            parents since anytime they would go to church, he would cry loudly while in the church or fall asleep in the entire session of the prayers.

        <p>
            When Sheikh Said John was six months old, his mother suffered great illness whereby her breasts became so dry that they could hardly produce any milk. This
            frustrated her mother who not only tried to seek healing from medical hospitals but also trusted Jesus for healing though this was in vain. Whenever they
            would pray with revered Johnson, their village pastor, Joseph would cry out raising his index finger which was an Islamic symbol of shahaadah. This symbol
            wasn’t clear to his mother and the more they prayed the more the child cried and consequently his mother’s illness would worsen.

        <p>
            At the age of three, terror stroke Mr. John’s home. His parent’s found out that their child had openly and clearly denounced his Christian name to Muslim
            name “Said”. He then proudly stated that he wasn’t a Christian but a truly committed Muslim. He was then heard reciting some Arabic like words which
            neither of his parents knew what they meant and too the person who taught him. Due to this, he was sent to Dares-salaam and was handed over to their Muslim
            niece Mariam Saidi Melita Kaaya.
        </p>
        <img src='<?php echo $base; ?>/assets/images/biography/004.jpg' alt='Sheikh Said John' />
        <p>
            This was seen as a safer way of getting rid of him for they could no longer live with a “possessed” child. During his stay with his cousin sister, he
            displayed various miraculous acts that amazed everyone. He constantly recited Qura'nic verses and Hadeeth quotations. This was amazing since a boy of his
            age couldn’t construct proper sentences with such detailed meaning. At one point, he was able to give a lecture to a huge congregation of elders
        </p>
        <p>
            At the age of five years he officially became a lecturer in several mosques in Dares-salaam city i.e. Masjid Tungi-central mosque of Temeke and many more.
            His main roles were to teach the community the words of guidance from Allah Ta’ala alongside with other sheikhs. His teachings shocked everyone since they
            couldn’t imagine how a young boy of five years could manage to deliver lectures.

        <p>
            In the very same year, he was invited by the chief sheikh of Dodoma region for a Daawah tour. During this visit, by his supplications, he managed to change
            the Gaddafi mosque which was in a terrifying situation into better mosque and is classified as one of the best outstanding mosques in the entire country up
            to date. This created attraction amongst Muslims of Shinyanga and they too went to Dodoma to visit him. He then toured many places in Tanzania i.e. Mwanza,
            Kagera and its districts like Ibwela and Katoro where he converted 1,256 Christians to Islam.

    <div>
        <p>
            At the age of eight, Sheikh Said John visited Mbeya region. It is from this place that the people from Malawi heard the shocking news about him and they
            thus invited him. When he went to Malawi, he visited many places. For instance Blantyre and its districts, Mzuzu and its districts amongst others and
            concluded his tour at Lilongwe the capital city of Malawi where he met the former president H. E Dr. Bakili Muluzi and shared some few words of wisdom with
            him. During this tour, he managed to convert seven hundred and fifty three (753) Christians to Islam
        </p>
        <img src='<?php echo $base; ?>/assets/images/biography/007.jpg' alt='Sheikh Said John' />
        <p>
            At the age of twelve years, Sheikh Said John visited Mozambique to spread the word of Allah. They visited the entire country of Mozambique, and concluded
            their tour at Maputo city. When at Maputo he met with the former president of Mozambique H.E Joaquem Chisano personally at his residence for a
            multi-religious discussion.
        </p>      
        <p>
            He attended all the ten regions of Mozambique and managed to convert twenty six thousands eight hundred and fifty four (26,854) Christians to Islam.

        <h3>Sheikh Said John’s Educational Life</h3>
        <p>
            At the age of fourteen years, Sheikh Said John put down the Dawah work on hold for education purposes. He joined Darul Uloom College in Pretoria South
            Africa for secular and religious studies. When he started schooling, he was found vigorous enough to begin at grade eight and thus ended up being promoted
            to grade eight instead of the usual format of education in that country. This enabled him to finish his studies at a time span of six years. He then
            furthered his Islamic education and graduated in 2007 as an Aalim. Concurrently he was taking his secondary level examination courses and managed to obtain
            an original certificate from Egyptian Al-Azhar Univerity. Still in college he participated in several lecture competitions which were organized in two
            international languages i.e. Arabic and English. Amazingly these two languages weren’t used in his native land but he would always emerge the best in both
            as he would be honored with trophies and prizes for inborn talent.
        </p>
        <img src='<?php echo $base; ?>/assets/images/biography/008.jpg' alt='Sheikh Said John' />
        <p>
            At the age of 18 years, he was elected as a full time teacher at the Darul Uloom
            Pretoria, where his roles were to give lessons of Nahw, Sarf, Hadeeth, Tafseerul Quran, and comparative religions; serving the religion of Allah at an
            academic dimension.

        <h3>The Sheikh’s ambitions in the Da’wah field</h3>
        <img src='<?php echo $base; ?>/assets/images/biography/009.jpg' alt='Sheikh Said John' />
        <p>
            When Sheikh returned to Tanzania in 2011 he had a vision of continuing with his Daawah activities as he used to do before. Thus, he developed his earlier
            idea of establishing and registering an organization. His idea came into reality where he registered his organization under a name “SAID JOHN DAAWAH TRUST
            FUND (SAJOF)”
        </p>
        <p>
            whose main goal was to enable him operate legally and efficiently at both local and global levels.This was because, most of his preaching involved
            travelling both internationally and locally to spread Islam. Sheikh Said John had a plan in his mind of visiting other countries in Africa thus his
            organization would enhance his facilitation to those countries in terms of travelling, their up keep,This couldn’t be so simple without funds to facilitate
            his journey and even feeding his team. The funds were as well to cater for expenses of the orphans towards giving them food and too equipping the destitute
            with Quran materials so as to be at par with Islamic teachings. Some of the objectives of this organization
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>are:-</p>
        <p>• To globally educate Muslims and the Non-Muslims.</p>
        <p>
            • To improve the lives of the poor Muslims of Africa in particular; educationally, spiritually and morally, as well as economically through a variety of
            Daawah and economic activities.
        </p>
        <p>• To arrange and manage public meetings, functions and seminars for the uplifting of Islam and the Muslims.</p>
        <p>
            • To establish and run some institutions in which the newly converted Muslims, destitute and orphans will have access to shelter, basic needs and education
            both academic and Islamic.
        </p>

        <h3>Sheikh Said John’s tour to India</h3>
        <p>

        <h3><strong>Sheikh</strong>Said<strong> </strong><strong>John’s Accomplishments and Cerebration</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Sheikh Said John’s life was an amazing one which positively changed lives of many both locally and internationally. This was due to his outstanding wealth
            of knowledge of Islamic religion background at a tender age. In his career as he served Allah, he performed several. After his education, he became a full
            time teacher in the very same school he went for his education courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sheikh Said John was able to convert his parents to Islam. This occurred in 1999 just before a trip to Malawi. His mother changed her name from Rose to
            Zainab. His father’s name changed from John to Hassan.
        </p>
        <img src='<?php echo $base; ?>/assets/images/biography/012.jpg' alt='Sheikh Said John' />
        
        <p>
            He therefore had to change his middle name to Hassan and thus most of his documents are in this new name “Said Hassan”. However, the name Said John is
            being used only for recognition and remembrance purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Malawi, he healed an Asian man whose legs were seriously limping to an extent of not moving to any point. This Asian man had earlier been taken to South
            Africa for medications but all was in vain because he was not cured. However, when Sheikh performed his Du’a (supplication) unto him, the following day the
            Asian man came by his own feet from his house, up to the place where Sheikh Said John was hosted to thank him.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            In Tanzania, a business man by the name Ramadhan Makaranga told Sheikh Said John about a loan of seventy three million TSHS that he lent to somebody but
            this person was refusing to pay him back. Sheikh Said John made a special Du’a in his house at that night according to the teachings of Prophet Mohammad
            PBUH. Three days later, in an unexpected way, his money was paid in cash at his house.
        </p>
        <p>
            During his visit in Dodoma region central Tanzania, by his supplications i.e. Du’a, he managed to change the Gaddafi mosque which was in a terrifying
            situation into better mosque and is classified as one of the best outstanding mosques in the entire country up to date.
        </p>
